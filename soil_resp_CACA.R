# This script reads in a single L2 sumdat file from the LiCor 6400-09 and summarizes the key output variables.
# This was created for 2023 Gobabeb IRES projects where soil respiration values are quite low.
# Due to issues with predicting dc/dt at a target value with very low respiration rates (see Heaather's 
# notes on this), this script calculates efflux for single drawdown cycle as the mean of all efflux values
# for this cycle.
# Created July 6, 2023 Heather Throop
# Updated July 24, 2023 for Calicorena group (HLT)
